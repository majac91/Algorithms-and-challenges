    <h1>Array.diff</h1>
    <p>
      Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which
      subtracts one list from another and returns the result. It should remove
      all values from list a, which are present in list b.
    </p>
    <p>arrayDiff([1,2], [1]) == [2]</p>
    <p>
      If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from
      the other:
    </p>
    <p>arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]</p>
